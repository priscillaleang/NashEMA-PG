No Limit Head-Up Texas Hold'em Environment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

no-limit Texas Hold'em poker environment optimized for two-player (heads-up) games.
The environment follows standard poker rules.

Card Encoding:
    Cards are encoded as integers from 0-51:
    - Suits: 0=Clubs, 1=Diamonds, 2=Hearts, 3=Spades  
    - Ranks: 0=2, 1=3, ..., 11=King, 12=Ace
    - Card value = rank + 13 * suit

Environment Configuration:
    - Starting stack: 200 chips per player
    - Small blind: 1 chip, Big blind: 2 chips
    - Maximum action history: `MAX_HISTORY_LENGTH` actions per hand
    - 16 possible actions per turn (fold, check/call, 12 raise sizes, all-in)

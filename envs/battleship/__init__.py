"""Battleship environment module.

This module provides a complete implementation of the Battleship game environment
for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The environment is organized into separate
modules for better maintainability:

- state.py: Environment state definitions
- setup.py: Setup stage logic (ship placement)
- gameplay.py: Play stage logic (combat mechanics)
- utils.py: Utility functions and constants

    """
    Battleship environment implementing the classic naval strategy game.
    
    This is a two-player turn-based game with two distinct phases:
    
    ## Game Flow
    
    ### Setup Stage (Stage 0)
    Players take turns placing their 5 ships on a 10x10 grid. Ship placement requires 2 steps:
    1. **Head Placement**: Choose where to place the ship's head position
    2. **Tail Placement**: Choose where to place the ship's tail position
    
    Ships must be placed in order: Carrier(5) → Battleship(4) → Cruiser(3) → Submarine(3) → Destroyer(2)
    Ships must be placed in straight lines (horizontal or vertical) without gaps.
    Setup ends when both players have placed all 5 ships.
    
    ### Play Stage (Stage 1)
    Players alternate taking shots at opponent's grid. The game ends when one player's
    ships are all destroyed (hit in all positions).
    
    ## Observation Space
    
    The observation contains:
    - `stage`: Current game stage (0=setup, 1=play)
    - `my_alive_ships`: Boolean array [5] indicating which of your ships are still alive
    - `enemy_alive_ships`: Boolean array [5] indicating which enemy ships are still alive
    - `board`: 10x10 grid with different meanings per stage
    
    ### Board Encoding
    
    **Setup Stage:**
    - `-1`: Occupied by Carrier (ship index 0)
    - `-2`: Occupied by Battleship (ship index 1)
    - `-3`: Occupied by Cruiser (ship index 2)
    - `-4`: Occupied by Submarine (ship index 3)
    - `-5`: Occupied by Destroyer (ship index 4)
    - `0`: Free space available for ship placement
    - `1`: Occupied by your current ship head (during tail placement)
    
    **Play Stage:**
    - `-1`: Miss (you shot here, no ship)
    - `0`: Unknown (not yet targeted)
    - `1`: Hit (you shot here, enemy ship present)
    
    ## Action Space
    
    Actions are positions on the 10x10 grid, represented as integers 0-99.
    Position `i*10 + j` corresponds to grid coordinates `(i, j)`.
    
    Valid actions are constrained by action masks (flattened to size 100):
    - **Setup Stage**: Only positions that allow valid ship placement
    - **Play Stage**: Only positions not yet targeted
    
    ## Ship Information
    
    Ships are placed in fixed order with sizes:
    - Index 0: Carrier (5 spaces)
    - Index 1: Battleship (4 spaces)
    - Index 2: Cruiser (3 spaces)
    - Index 3: Submarine (3 spaces)
    - Index 4: Destroyer (2 spaces)
    
    ## Winning Conditions
    
    A player wins when all opponent ships are completely destroyed.
